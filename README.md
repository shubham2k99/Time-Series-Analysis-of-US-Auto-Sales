# Time-Series-Analysis-of-US-Auto-Sales

This project aims to analyze and forecast US auto sales using time series models. Specifically, it explores the effectiveness of deterministic and stochastic time series models in capturing the variations in monthly auto sales data spanning from January 1995 to December 2020. The primary objective is to determine the most suitable model for forecasting auto sales, with a focus on the Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. The project evaluates model performance based on a training sample of 288 observations and validates forecasts using a holdout sample of 24 months, emphasizing the SARIMA (0,1,1)(0,1,1)[12] model, which demonstrates the lowest error rate of 7.75% and residuals resembling a white noise series.
